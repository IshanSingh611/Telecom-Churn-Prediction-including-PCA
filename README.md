# Telecom-Churn-Prediction-including-PCA
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate and moreover, it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

That’s why, the telecom industry wants  to build models  –

a) To predict which customers are at high risk of churn. By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.

b) To identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.


For that the business objective is set as to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months.


To find the prediction of the churn, we are going to find out the interpretation by the following below steps –

1. Data Understanding and Handling Missing Data
2. Filter High-Value-Customers (HVC) 
3. Advance Imputation of data - to replace NaN values
4. Derive Churn 

5.  More Steps : 
i)  Derived Variables
ii) EDA
iii) Outlier Treatment 

6. Modelling 
i)  With PCA, three models  
ii) Without PCA, one model
